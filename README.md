# My Dotfiles
My Personal Dotfiles, Finally stored in git becuase of [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

These dotfiles draw inspiration from the excellent work of others in the
community:

*   [jdx/dotfiles-ng](https://github.com/jdx/dotfiles-ng)
*   [denolfe/dotfiles](https://github.com/denolfe/dotfiles)

## Usage

_Prerequisites: python, git, zsh_

### Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:EAliakbar/dotfiles.git .dotfiles --recursive
cd .dotfiles
./install
```

## Included Configurations

Here's a glimpse of what's currently managed in these dotfiles:

*   `gitconf` (`.gitignore`, `.gitconfig`)
*   `vscode` (settings, keybindings, extensions)
*   `ghostty` (terminal emulator configuration)

## Future Enhancements (Todo)
- [] Adding a Makefile
- [] ssh configs (Need a Private repo)
- [] Zsh configs
- [] Bash aliases
- [] Separate Profile for servers/bastions
